# Pseudo-static binaries for BlueBuild project

I made this, because we need utilities that would work everywhere, like some `coreutils`, `sed`, `awk`, `curl` and `wget`.

Those pseudo-static binaries are built thanks to [`sharun`](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun)'s wrappe feature, which bundles all needed libraries needed for the binary.
